/**
 * Provides a mechanism for WordPress theme developers to easily modify the content of an HTML page based on tag markers.  
 *
 * Content is filtered by a sequence of replacement rules.  Rules tell the filter how
 * to match a block of HTML, what HTML code to insert relative to the matched block,
 * and where the new code is to be inserted.
 *
 * A block is defined by an opening match and optionally a closing match.  If only an
 * opening is provided, the block is only the tag matched.  If both an opening and closing
 * are provided, the block includes everything from the opening match to the closing 
 * match.
 * 
 * To make that concrete, consider an `h2` element:
 *
 *     <h2>My Heading</h2>
 *
 * The block for a rule matching only the opening `'h2'` is strictly the opening tag:
 *
 *     <h2>
 *
 * Whereas the block for a rule matching the opening `'h2'` and the closing `'/h2'` 
 * contains the entire heading, including the text "My Heading".
 *
 * The replacement rules are added to the content sectioner by calling the `replace_*` methods.  The rules are run in the order they are added.  The only difference between the different replace methods is where within the content the current and next search are performed.

  /**
   * Takes the supplied replacement rule and fills in defaults for values not supplied.
   *
   * A replacement rule, as provided to any of the `replace_*` methods, is an array 
   * with certain expected option key values.  Those keys that may be supplied, 
   * their default values, and the affect each option has on how a replacement rule
   * does its job, are:
   * 
   * - `open_tag` (required, unless `open_regex` is provided) The tag to be matched to 
   *   fire this rule.  It is specified as
   *   a simple string without the angle brackets.  For example, `'h2'` matches a second
   *   level heading tag.  To match a close tag, include the leading forward slash (eg.
   *   `'/h2'` to match closing a second level heading).
   * - `open_insert` (default: the empty string `''`) The HTML to insert when this rule is fired at the 
   *   opening of the matched block.
   * - `open_policy` (default: `'replace'`) How the `open_insert` text should be inserted 
   *   into the content.  The choices are:
   *   - `'replace'` to completely replace the opening match and start the next search at the end of the replacement text
   *   - `'before'` to insert the text just before the opening match and start the next search at the end of the _opening match_ (excluding the opening match from the next search in order to protect against infinite loops).
   *   - `'after'` to insert the text just after the opening match and start the next search at the end of the inserted text
   * - `open_regex` (default: `false`) If provided, it will override the `open_tag` value.  To be used if finer grain matching is needed.  A full regex string should be supplied, with opening and closing slashes (eg. `'/<hr.*>/'`)
   * - `close_tag` (default: `false`) If provided, the tag to match to serve as the end of
   *   the matched block.  If the tag specified is not encountered, the end of the content
   *   will serve as a match.
   * - `close_insert` (default: the empty string `''`) The HTML to insert at the 
   *   closing of the matched block.
   * - `close_policy` (default: `'replace'`) How the `close_insert` text should be inserted 
   *   into the content.  The choices are:
   *   - `'replace'` to completely replace the closing match and start the next search at the end of the replacement text
   *   - `'before'` to insert the text just before the closing match and start the next search at the end of the _inserted text_ (leaving the closing match available to be matched as the opening of the next rule)
   *   - `'after'` to insert the text just after the closing match and start the next search at the end of the inserted text
   * - `close_regex` (default: `false`) If provided, it will override the `close_tag` value.  To be used if finer grain matching is needed.  A full regex string should be supplied, with opening and closing slashes (eg. `'/<hr.*>/'`)
   * - 'close_strict' (default: 'false') If false, the end of the content will serve
   *   as a match for the close tag or regex if no exact match is found.  If true, the
   *   replacement rule will not fire unless a strict match is found.
   *
